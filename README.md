From this project, I have attempted to emulate the google homepage without inspection in order to have a sense of the 
website's functionalities just by pure observation. 

These are the things that I found challenging and the opportunities it has given me to improve on my coding skills:

Challenging: 
(1)centering the buttons when webpage isn't responsive to user vs when the user decides to change the window size
(2)positioning two groups of buttons on the same footer.
(3)Figuring out the most accurate font/color scheme of the webpage

Opportunities: 
(1)Organization is a major key to my project since the user/coder most know what they are looking at when
inspecting or commiting changes as a group.
(2)I could've used the image of the google logo instead of guessing the actual font and color.
(3)I might need to learn how to make every part of the website responsive since they do not behave the way i wanted them to(example: buttons don't move in the right position as I would have expected)
(4)When resizing the windows a few times, some of the buttons got cluttered and overlapped. 
(5)I might need to learn Javascript to record users' search time and information when they're inputting keywords in the search bar

Results:
The placement of the buttons as well as the footer and logo was fairly accurate to say the less but much work needs to be done 
on the responsiveness of the webpage. I'll also consider learning javascript along the way.
